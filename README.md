## Particle Gravitation Simulation

This Rust project simulates the force of gravity based on Newton's law of gravitation on particles in space. In the code you can set constants like the gravitational constant, g, and "create" particles.

As an example I have created the Earth and the Moon scaled down. The X and Y axis represent the objects poisition in a 2D plans and the Z axis represents time.
